## Fit or Flab

an Android practice app focusing on Activities and their interactions / lifecycles, as well as layout.

Review of Intents (passing data from one activity to another, usually with the purpose of identifying which data
to display on a generalized activity for a certain 'model').

Independent exercise at the end was to properly enable a 'night mode' setting, which if on would change background colors, and be saved throughout the session, using `SharedPreferences`.
